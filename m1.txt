"Today, I explored the basics of Git and its practical applications in version control. I learned how to create repositories, branch out for organizing tasks, and collaborate effectively with teammates. It’s fascinating to see how version control can make teamwork more efficient and help recover older versions of work when needed. Apart from this, I reflected on my goals for the week—improving my understanding of dynamic data structures and preparing for the upcoming project presentation. Staying consistent and organized feels like the key to progress!"
