Collaboration is at the heart of our Git project, and today we simulated working as a team by creating and merging branches. I realized how important it is to communicate effectively to avoid conflicts while editing files. The process of resolving a merge conflict was both challenging and rewardingâ€”it taught me how Git tracks changes and maintains version history. Beyond the technical aspects, I also noted down some ideas for organizing my study notes more efficiently. This project is not just about learning Git but also about developing habits for better teamwork and productivity.
